### Choosing your plot type based on your data

- **Quantitative**: The information is recorded as numbers and represents an objective measurement or a count. Temperature, weight, and a count of transactions are all quantitative data. Analysts also refer to this type as numerical data.
  - Continuous vs Discrete
  - Continuous
    - 1 Variable: Histogram
    - 2 Variables Scatter plot
    - 1 Variable w Group/Categorical Variable: Boxplot, Violin Plot
  - Discrete
    - 1 Variable: Bar Charts (Horizontal, Vertical)

Single Continuous Numeric Variable
- Density (cumulative distribution function) plot
- Histogram
- Box Plot - when stratifying by multiple categories of another variable


- **Qualitative**: The information represents characteristics that you do not measure with numbers. Instead, the observations fall within a countable number of groups. In fact, this type of variable can capture information that isnâ€™t easily measured and can be subjective. Taste, eye color, architectural style, and marital status are all types of qualitative variables.
  - Categorical, Binary, and Ordinal


### Statistical Tests based on data types

- Chi-squared test of independence when you have two or more categorical variables
