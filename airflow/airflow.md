  - Inputing Connections via the GUI helps "hide" them, perhaps a better way to avoid GUI and still protect your credentials?
  - Great hands-on view of building out your own Operator (e.g. Load data from S3 to RedShift)

### Airflow Workers

#### LocalExector
After some time you'll likely max out the workers on that local instance and so then you would need something like the `CeleryExecutor` or `MesosExecutor`

### Data Lineage
- Where did this data come from?

- Currently, no built in direct way how objects are related, graphed together.
- Need Metadata and doing analytics on it would lead to featuring these relationships.




### Airflow Workflow



Here is how we manage it for our team.

#### DAGS
- Naming Convention: each DAG file (my_dag_v1.0.py) is also the name of the DAG(my_dag_v1.0, ...). Update the version number each time you update/change/alter that DAG. This makes it easy to go back a version as well as easily distinguish the change over a lot of runs over time.

```python
# my_dag_v1.0.py #file name
from airflow import DAG
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

default_args = {
  'owner': 'airflow',
  'depends_on_past': False,
  'start_date': datetime(2016,10,11,21,53),
  'email': ['airflow@mail.com'],
  'email_on_failure': True
}

dag = DAG(
  'my_dag_v1.0', # update the version whenver you change the DAG .py file
  default_args=default_args,
  schedule_interval="0,15,30,45 * * * *",
  dagrun_timeout=timedelta(hours=24),
  max_active_runs=1)

```

#### Process to update DAGs
- All DAG files are stored in a Git repository. Each time a merge request is merged to our master branch, the CI pipeline (Travis or Circle CI) starts a new build and packages our DAG files into a zip and the file is sent to the Airflow server.
- A potential DEV => STG => PROD testing process and user acceptance can be implemented. Or STG => PROD. This should be automated and could be integrated with a chat service hook like Slack.
