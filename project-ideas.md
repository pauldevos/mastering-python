# Project Ideas

### Python GUI Program - Shot Chart capture tool
This would be a program that is downloadable to any operating system (Windows, Mac, Linux) where it would have an interactive screen that is a basketball court as well as the rosters for each team playing in the game. The app would allow someone to watch a basketball game and create a shot chart for each team.

#### Features
- Rosters listed with player name and number on side panel (tap/click to select)
- Tap/Click on Court to assign shot, popup make/miss pops up after touch. (assigns X or O)
- Shots have team color by team (home vs away - can pick team color)
- Outprint of shots text at bottom (or another tab)
- (player A shoots 18 foot shot)
- other possible features:
  - assisted by
    - tap shoot, player 1, assist, player 2, touch court
    - or tap player_2 column in table, tap player, tap assist
- auto saves on all actions
- Upload to GDrive, Save to Laptop/iPad/iPhone/etc.
